Crystal Technology Mod Credits:
========================================================================

First and Foremost Thanks Go to Mojang for Minecraft itself, the Entire Forge Community for their tireless work
on keeping modding alive, and finally thanks to Oracle for Java 17 & 18 specifically since it's been making life
easier for making this mod.

Next up I will always be thankful for Westwood/EAs Command and Conquer, Bandai Namco/ Sunrise for Mobile Suit Gundam,
and Harmony Gold/Big West Studio Nue For Robotech. Please do not Nuke this guys.

Next on the List is Tutorials by Kaupenjoe For the Amazing Tutorials on how to dive head first into this and tread
water.

A special Thanks Goes out to Brohammer the author of Tiberium Craft for letting me study bits of his code, so I could
make my own Tiberium growth logic.

And last but not least my Partner in crime, and co-conspirator My older brother Che K Carter for his help in reviewing
the code for bugs, putting up with my late night discord messages crowing about my successes or Cussing at my
failures, and for helping me bring this mod up to 1.20.1
