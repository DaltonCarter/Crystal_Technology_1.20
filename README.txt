CRYSTAL TECHNOLOGY MOD
-------------------------------------------

NOTICE: This is the 1.20.1 version of the mod!


The Short and sweet of this mod is that it is a combination of some of my favorite sci-fi technologies and my own
original Sci-fi technologies.

THINGS YOU MIGHT RECOGNISE:
------------------------------------------
One of the Dominant features of this mod is what I refer to as Tiberium Technology Which at its roots is based upon
Command and Conquer Tiberium Dawn, Tiberium Sun: Firestorm, and some aesthetic features from Tiberium Wars.

Things that are directly inspired by C & C include:
1. Riparius (Green) Tiberium Crystal Growths, and Molten Liquid
2. Vinifera (Blue) Tiberium Crystal Growths, and Molten Liquid
3. Cruentus (Red) Tiberium Crystal Growths, and Molten Liquid
4. Aboreus (Purple) Tiberium Crystal Growths, and Molten Liquid
5. GDI and NOD Factions are referenced in structures and mobs.*
6. Giant Crystal Formations
7. Biomes Inspired by the Yellow and Red Zones*
8. Tiberium Infected Water
9. Tiberium Blossom Tree
10. Environmental Effects
11. Select machines and equipment*

Later features begin involving what was known as Reflex Technology which was the technology used in the 1980's
anime Robotech.

Features that are directly inspired by Robotech:
1. The Invid Flower of Life aka Protoculture
2. Invid inspired Mobs*
3. Protoculture themed equipment, structures, and machinery.*

Peripheral features with modified elements of Mobile Suit Gundam are present in the form of:

1. Gundanium Metal and equipment. -Gundanium in the anime was an alloy, here it is a simple mineable metal.
2. Weapons inspired by the Shows I.E Gundam Wings Buster Rifle, Beam Sabers*

* All features marked are currently in development and may or may not be present in the code.

With all of that in mind, this mod goes above and beyond those features by including features that are original:

Core Technology: Originally thought up by my elder brother Che K Carter, Core Technology Later became Crystal Core
Technology once I learned enough about it to make my own additions. It is HEAVILY inspired by Reflex Technology.

This technology has at its center several different colored "Core Crystals" that each do something different. Most
Notably are the RED crystals which are used in weapons, and are HIGHLY VOLATILE simply dropping one can result in
an explosion equivalant to a nuclear explosion. Frequently used as a "HAIL MARY" tactic Soldiers have thrown these
crystals and beamed back onto the cruiser they are assigned to.

Core Technology also features a multi-stage metal alloy called "Core Steel" which has been used in everything from
 melee weapons, to Mecha, and space cruisers. Even though the Mecha WILL NOT be in this MOD, and the Cruisers will
 only be present as Crashed structures, Core steel will be a central part of your machinery, and even as a decoration
 block as when finished it will be explosion proof, AND have a restraining effect on Tiberium spread.


 Crystal Resonance Technology is a form of Magi-Tech Created by yours truly. This technology is prevalent in my written
  works and is also used in Mecha, Industry, hand weaponry, space technology, and armor. AGAIN Mecha will not be in
  the mod, and ships will only be present as crashed structures. This technology will be key in accessing late
  game machines, weapons, and armor. it was specifically designed both to stand alone and be interwoven with the
  other technologies above.

  The true vision for this mod is to bring all of the above together to create a unique tech mod that can double
  as a survival challange, or simply also have effects on the vanilla survival experience.
